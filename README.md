# Metronome

This is a small metronome created in the "neumorphism" design style.

It includes all the functionality of the Google metronome application you get if you Google search for `metronome` (as of January 2020, anyway), plus an additional feature to accent the first beat of a bar in 2/4, 3/4, 4/4, 5/4 or 6/4 times. (In the far distant future, who knows - maybe I will expand this to allow arbitrary other time signatures.)

The purpose of this app was to highlight the neumorphism design style, and not necessarily act as a perfect metronome. For instance, it will stop ticking if the user tabs away to another tab in the browser. The highlight here is the aesthetic, not the logic.
